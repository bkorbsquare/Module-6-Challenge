# Module-6-Challenge

## Description

- This code displays a Weather Dashboard.
- I wanted to deploy this site to be able to see weather data pertaining to a given city using JavaScript and third party API's.
- I coded JavaScript using Jquery and the OpenWeather API.
- Given more time I would polish the styling and comments.
